   * Optimised find for special and hard linked files.
     Thanks, Rike-Benjamin Schuppner.
   * Adjust when Pacman 5 calls etckeeper hooks.
     Thanks, Tilman Blumenbach and Christian Hesse.
   * Only run Pacman hooks when files in /etc have changed.
     Thanks, Christian Hesse.
   * Added systemd timer that can run etckeeper 10 minutes after boot, and also
     daily. It's not enabled by default, partly because of overlap with the
     cron job.
     Thanks, Christian Hesse."""]]
